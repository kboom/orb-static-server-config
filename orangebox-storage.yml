server:
  port: 5501

eureka:
  instance:
    appname: orangebox-storage
    hostname: localhost
#    nonScurePort: 5501 # works with this one, it seems that when using no security it ignores the server port and uses this property
  client:
    serviceUrl:
      defaultZone: http://localhost:8761/eureka/
#    instanceId: ${spring.application.name}:${spring.application.instance_id:${random.value}} # use this for testing multiple instances at a single host (in production it makes no sense though)
